AutocleanEEG Pipeline lets you change how the command-line interface looks. You can pick a theme that works best for you, like dark, light, high-contrast, or monochrome.

## Choosing a Theme

You can set the theme when you run a command:

```bash
autocleaneeg-pipeline --theme dark list-tasks
```

Available themes:

- `auto` (default)
- `dark`
- `light`
- `hc` (high contrast)
- `mono` (monochrome)

## Environment Variables

You can also set a theme and color options with environment variables:

- `AUTOCLEAN_THEME` — set the theme (auto, dark, light, hc, mono)
- `AUTOCLEAN_COLOR_DEPTH` — set color depth (auto, 8, 256, truecolor)
- `NO_COLOR=1` — turn off all colors
- `FORCE_COLOR=1` — force color output

Example:

```bash
export AUTOCLEAN_THEME=light
export NO_COLOR=1
```

## How It Works

All commands use the same color and style settings. You don’t need to change anything else—just pick your theme and go!

If you don’t set a theme, AutocleanEEG will try to pick one that matches your terminal.
