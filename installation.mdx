## Global Installation (Recommended)

You can install AutocleanEEG either globally for use across projects or by cloning the repository for local customization.

### Prerequisites

AutocleanEEG Pipeline is a Python application. We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), a fast Python package installer.

<Info>
**Why use Astral uv?**  
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a next-generation Python package manager that dramatically speeds up installs and dependency resolution. It is fully compatible with pip, supports modern Python workflows, and can make managing Python environments much faster and more reliable.
</Info>



### Installing the Stable version

To install AutocleanEEG globally, use the following command:

```bash
uv tool install autocleaneeg-pipeline
```

<Info>
**What is `uv tool install`?**  
The `uv tool install` command lets you globally install Python applications as command-line tools, similar to `pipx`. This means you can run the installed tool from any terminal, regardless of your current project, folder, or environment.
</Info>

### Installing from Source

If you prefer to customize or contribute to AutocleanEEG, you can clone the repository and install it locally. Live edits to the code will be reflected immediately when you run the executable (including PDB breakpoints).

```bash

git clone https://github.com/cincibrainlab/autocleaneeg-pipeline.git
cd autocleaneeg-pipeline
uv tool install -e --upgrade .

```

### Platform-Specific Notes

#### macOS and Linux

AutocleanEEG Pipeline is fully compatible with macOS and **Linux** systems. All installation and usage instructions above have been tested on these platforms.

<Info>
On a fresh Debian/Ubuntu Linux install you may need development headers and Qt runtime libraries (often required for PyQt-related features).

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install -y python3.10-dev build-essential pkg-config
sudo apt install -y qtbase5-dev qtchooser qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev-tools libxkbcommon-x11-0 libxrender1 libsm6 libxext6 libxcb1 libx11-xcb1
```
</Info>

##### (Optional) Install system build dependencies (Linux)


#### Windows Users

While native Windows support is under active testing, we currently recommend using [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) for the best experience. WSL allows you to run a Linux environment directly on Windows, ensuring compatibility with all AutocleanEEG features.

To get started with WSL:

1. [Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
2. Open your WSL terminal.
3. Follow the Linux installation instructions above.

If you encounter any issues on Windows or WSL, please [open an issue](https://github.com/your-repo/issues) on our GitHub repository.

## Troubleshooting

### Installing uv


<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title='Issue: Installed uv but "uv" command not found'>
        This is usually a PATH issue.
        
        Steps:
        1. Confirm install: `python -m pip show uv` (if you installed via pip) or follow the official installer instructions.
        2. Ensure the uv bin directory is on PATH:
             - macOS/Linux (typical): `~/.local/bin` or the location printed by the installer.
             - Add to shell (bash/zsh): `echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc` (or `.zshrc`) then restart the terminal.
        3. Restart the terminal (or run `exec $SHELL`).
        4. Test: `uv --version`.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Issue: "autocleaneeg-pipeline" command not found after install'>
        Cause: Installed with `uv add` inside a project (adds as a dependency) instead of a global tool install.
        
        Solution:
        1. Uninstall any local attempts: remove from `pyproject.toml` if added.
        2. Run global install: `uv tool install autocleaneeg-pipeline`
        3. Verify tool path: `uv tool list`
        4. Ensure the uv tools bin dir is on PATH (printed by `uv tool dir`).
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Issue: Changes to local source not reflected when running command'>
        Ensure you installed in editable mode when working from a cloned repo.
        
        Steps:
        1. From repo root: `uv tool install -e --upgrade .`
        2. Confirm the tool points to your workspace: `uv tool list | grep autocleaneeg-pipeline`
        3. If still stale: `uv tool uninstall autocleaneeg-pipeline` then reinstall.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Issue: Need to upgrade to latest release'>
        Run:
        ```bash
        uv tool install --upgrade autocleaneeg-pipeline
        ```
        If still old, clear cache:
        ```bash
        uv cache clean
        uv tool install --force-reinstall autocleaneeg-pipeline
        ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Issue: Permission denied (global install)'>
        uv installs tools into a user-owned directory (no sudo needed). If you used sudo previously, file ownership may be wrong.
        
        Fix:
        1. Remove sudo-installed copy (if any).
        2. Reinstall normally: `uv tool install autocleaneeg-pipeline`
        3. If PATH still points to a root-owned location, adjust PATH to prefer the user tool dir.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Issue: Command runs but imports fail (missing dependencies)'>
        Possible corrupted or partial install.
        
        Fix:
        ```bash
        uv tool uninstall autocleaneeg-pipeline
        uv cache clean
        uv tool install autocleaneeg-pipeline
        ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Issue: Using Windows (PowerShell) and command not found'>
        If using WSL, install and run inside the WSL shell (Ubuntu, etc.).
        
        Native Windows:
        1. Ensure Scripts directory on PATH (e.g. `%APPDATA%\Python\Scripts` or the uv tools dir from `uv tool dir`).
        2. Close and reopen PowerShell.
        3. Try: `where autocleaneeg-pipeline`.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Issue: Need to uninstall / reset'>
        Uninstall:
        ```bash
        uv tool uninstall autocleaneeg-pipeline
        ```
        Remove cached artifacts (optional):
        ```bash
        uv cache clean
        ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Issue: "uv: command not found" after installing via curl script'>
        The installer prints where uv was placed. Add that directory to PATH and restart the shell.
        
        Example (bash/zsh):
        ```bash
        echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
        exec $SHELL
        ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Issue: Accidentally used "uv add autocleaneeg-pipeline" in a project'>
        That only adds it as a dependency; it won't expose a global CLI.
        
        Fix:
        1. Remove the dependency from `pyproject.toml` (if undesired).
        2. Run: `uv tool install autocleaneeg-pipeline`
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='General: How to see where the tool binary lives'>
        Run:
        ```bash
        uv tool dir
        ```
        Then ensure that directory is on PATH. List tools:
        ```bash
        uv tool list
        ```
