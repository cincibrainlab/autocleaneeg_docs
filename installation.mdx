## Installing AutocleanEEG

There are two main ways to install AutocleanEEG. You can install it as a **global tool** for convenient use across projects with a simple command, or **clone the repository** to install it locally, allowing easy editing and customization of the code.

### Prerequisites

AutocleanEEG is a Python application. We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), a fast Python package installer.

### Global Installation (Recommended)

To install AutocleanEEG globally, use the following command:

```bash
uv add autoclean-eeg
```

This command will make AutocleanEEG available from any terminal session, allowing you to use it across different projects without needing to install it separately for each one.

```bash
uv add autoclean-eeg
```

Alternatively, you can install with `pip` or `uv pip`:

```bash
uv pip install autoclean-eeg
```

```bash
pip install autoclean-eeg
```
