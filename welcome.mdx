**AutocleanEEG Pipeline** is an easy-to-use command line application for automated EEG processing. It is designed for **modular**, **reproducible**, and **audit-ready** processing of high-volume EEG data. Despite its automation focus, it provides highly visual outputs, intuitive data viewing, and extensive customization. **AutocleanEEG Pipeline** is built on a foundation of MNE-Python and other opensource tools.

Cleaning an EEG file with a preprocessing pipeline in AutocleanEEG is simple and requires just a few steps after opening a terminal.

### Install AutocleanEEG Pipeline


<CodeGroup>
```bash mac/linux

uv tool install autocleaneeg-pipeline


```

```shell win
# Install Python (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

uv tool install git+https://github.com/cincibrainlab/autoclean_pipeline.git
```

</CodeGroup>


<CodeGroup>
```bash mac/linux
# Install Python (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv tool install git+https://github.com/cincibrainlab/autoclean_pipeline.git
```

```shell win
# Install Python (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

uv tool install git+https://github.com/cincibrainlab/autoclean_pipeline.git
```

</CodeGroup>


```python {2, 6, 7}
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi_mcp import FastApiMCP

app = FastAPI()

mcp = FastApiMCP(app)
mcp.mount_http()
```
That's it! Your auto-generated MCP server is now available at `https://app.base.url/mcp`

## Features

- [**Authentication**](/advanced/auth) built in, using your existing FastAPI dependencies!

- **FastAPI-native:** Not just another OpenAPI -> MCP converter

- **Zero configuration** required - just point it at your FastAPI app and it works

- **Preserving schemas** of your request models and response models

- **Preserve documentation** of all your endpoints, just as it is in Swagger

- [**Flexible deployment**](/advanced/deploy) - Mount your MCP server to the same app, or deploy separately

- [**ASGI interface**](/advanced/asgi) - Uses FastAPI's ASGI interface directly for efficient internal communication
