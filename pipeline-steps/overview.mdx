## Introduction

The **Pipeline Reference** is a catalog of the core methods available in AutoCleanEEG.  
Each method corresponds to a preprocessing step that can be called inside a Task class, from raw data import to ICA and quality control.  

These methods are designed to be:
- **Composable** â€“ each method takes an EEG object (`Raw`, `Epochs`, `Evoked`) and returns a transformed version for the next step.  
- **Configurable** â€“ parameters can be set in the taskâ€™s `config` dictionary.  
- **Transparent** â€“ every method is logged, and many produce annotated outputs or QC figures.  

## Adding New Methods

AutoCleanEEG Pipeline is built to be **extensible**. You can add new functionality in two main ways:

1. **Extend the Task class**  
   - Write a custom method inside your Task file.  
   - Call it from `run()` at the point you want it executed.  
   - Return a valid MNE object so downstream steps can continue.

2. **Contribute to the pipeline core**  
   - Add a new method to `autoclean.core.task.Task`.  
   - Document it in the Pipeline Reference with its parameters and outputs.  
   - This makes it available to all Task files.

Because the system passes full MNE objects through each step, new methods can leverage:
- The entire [MNE-Python API](https://mne.tools/) (filtering, time-frequency analysis, source localization).  
- External libraries (scikit-learn, NumPy, SciPy).  
- Even MATLAB or EEGLAB functions, by exporting/importing intermediate files or using the MATLAB Engine for Python.

## Our Approach During Development

<Note>
ðŸ“– **Documentation in Progress**  
We are actively expanding the Pipeline Reference. Some methods are fully documented here, while others are listed as part of our **default task templates** during development.  

This ensures users can **see the full sequence of steps used by default**, even if individual method pages are still being written.
</Note>

Default templates include steps such as:
- Import and resample  
- Filtering (high-pass, low-pass, notch)  
- Bad channel detection  
- Re-referencing  
- ICA and component classification  
- Epoching and epoch cleaning  
- QC reporting  


## Big Picture

Think of the Pipeline Reference as both a **library of reusable functions** and a **map of the default workflow**. You can stick to the defaults, or extend the pipeline with your own methods, branching logic, and external tools. The goal is to make preprocessing **transparent, reproducible, and adaptable** to the needs of your study.
