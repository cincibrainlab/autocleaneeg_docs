<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisites">
  - AutocleanEEG Pipeline (see [Installation](http://localhost:3000/installation))
  - Download our Resting EEG example dataset from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/17042258)
</Step>

<Step title="Check Workspace Location">

By default, AutocleanEEG Pipeline creates a workspace folder named **`Autoclean-EEG`** inside your **Documents** folder.

* Verify the workspace location:

```bash
% autocleaneeg-pipeline workspace show

      AutocleanEEG Pipeline Workspace                                             
          Current configuration                                      

  âœ“ Workspace ~/Documents/Autoclean-EEG                              
          ðŸ’¾ Free space 472.9 GB                                      

```

<Tip>
To open the workspace in your file explorer try:

`autocleaneeg-pipeline workspace explore`
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="List Tasks">

List available tasks in your workspace:

```bash
autocleaneeg-pipeline task list
```

<img src="/images/first-pipeline-task-list.png" alt="AutocleanEEG task list showing built-in and custom tasks" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem', marginTop: '0.75rem' }} />

<Tip>
Task creation can be entirely custom and complex, incorporating Python, R, or MATLAB code. For this guide, we're using a simple built-in task to get you started quickly.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Copy Task">

Copy the built-in `RestingState_Basic` task and rename it for our tutorial:

```bash
autocleaneeg-pipeline task copy RestingState_Basic RestingState_Tutorial
```

This creates a custom copy that you can modify without affecting the original built-in task.

</Step>

<Step title="Set Active Task">

Set the copied task as your active task:

```bash
autocleaneeg-pipeline task set
```

Select the number corresponding to `RestingState_Tutorial` from the displayed list.

</Step>

<Step title="Set Input File">

Set the input EEG file for processing:

```bash
autocleaneeg-pipeline input set
```

Copy and paste the full path to your downloaded example file when prompted.

<Tip>
You can also set a folder path for batch processing multiple files at once.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Confirm Configuration">

Verify that workspace, task, and input are all properly configured:

```bash
autocleaneeg-pipeline
```

This displays your current pipeline configuration and confirms everything is set correctly.

</Step>

<Step title="Run Pipeline">

Start the processing pipeline:

```bash
autocleaneeg-pipeline process
```

Confirm the details when prompted and type `yes` to start the pipeline running.

</Step>

<Step title="View Outputs">

When processing is complete, explore the generated outputs:

```bash
autocleaneeg-pipeline workspace explore
```

This opens your workspace folder to view the processed results and quality control outputs.
