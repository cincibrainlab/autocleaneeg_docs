## Overview

Tasks in AutocleanEEG define the processing pipeline configuration and steps for your EEG data analysis. The CLI provides comprehensive task management capabilities through the `autocleaneeg-pipeline task` command suite.

## Task Command Overview

Running `autocleaneeg-pipeline task` displays the current workspace status and all available task commands:

```bash
autocleaneeg-pipeline task
```

This shows:
- Current workspace location and free space
- Active task (if set)
- Input file (if configured)
- Complete list of available task commands

## Available Task Commands

### Core Commands

| Command | Description | Usage |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `task list` | List all available tasks | Shows built-in, custom, and skipped tasks |
| `task set` | Set the active task | Interactive selection if task name omitted |
| `task copy` | Copy an existing task | Creates customizable copy of built-in tasks |
| `task edit` | Edit a task file | Opens task configuration for modification |
| `task show` | Display active task details | Shows current task configuration |

### Management Commands

| Command | Description | Usage |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `task import <path>` | Import external task file | Copy task file into workspace |
| `task delete` | Remove a task | Delete custom tasks (built-ins protected) |
| `task unset` | Clear active task | Remove current task selection |
| `task explore` | Open tasks folder | Launch file explorer in tasks directory |

## Task Types

### Built-in Tasks

Pre-configured processing pipelines included with AutocleanEEG:

```bash
autocleaneeg-pipeline task list
```

Example output shows:
- **RestingState_Basic**: Standard resting-state EEG preprocessing pipeline
- Ready-to-use configurations for common analysis workflows
- Cannot be modified directly (copy first for customization)

### Custom Tasks  

User-created or copied tasks stored in your workspace:

- Created through `task copy` or `task import`
- Fully customizable Python-based processing pipelines
- Stored as `.py` files in workspace `tasks/` directory
- Can incorporate Python, R, or MATLAB processing code

### Task Files

The system categorizes task files as:

- **Valid Tasks**: Properly formatted and executable
- **Skipped Files**: Templates or invalid configurations
- **Built-in Tasks**: Core AutocleanEEG processing modules

## Common Workflows

### Creating a Custom Task

1. **Copy a built-in task:**
   ```bash
   autocleaneeg-pipeline task copy RestingState_Basic MyCustomTask
   ```

2. **Set as active:**
   ```bash
   autocleaneeg-pipeline task set MyCustomTask
   ```

3. **Edit configuration:**
   ```bash
   autocleaneeg-pipeline task edit
   ```

### Working with Tasks

1. **List available tasks:**
   ```bash
   autocleaneeg-pipeline task list
   ```

2. **Set active task interactively:**
   ```bash
   autocleaneeg-pipeline task set
   ```

3. **View current configuration:**
   ```bash
   autocleaneeg-pipeline task show
   ```

## Task Configuration

Tasks define:
- **Processing steps**: Filtering, artifact removal, referencing
- **Parameters**: Thresholds, frequency bands, rejection criteria  
- **Quality control**: Automated flagging and validation
- **Output formats**: File types and organization

<Note>
Task creation can be entirely custom and complex, incorporating Python, R, or MATLAB code for specialized processing workflows.
</Note>

## Best Practices

- **Copy before customizing**: Always copy built-in tasks rather than modifying them directly
- **Descriptive naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for custom tasks
- **Version control**: Consider backing up custom tasks outside the workspace
- **Testing**: Validate custom tasks on sample data before batch processing
- **Documentation**: Document custom task modifications for reproducibility
