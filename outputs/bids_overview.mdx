# The `bids/` Folder

Each pipeline run outputs results in **BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure)** format, a widely adopted standard for EEG and neuroimaging data. This ensures your cleaned data are interoperable with other tools (e.g., EEGLAB-BIDS, MNE-BIDS, BIDS Validator).

The `bids/` subfolder contains:

* **Cleaned continuous and epoched EEG data** in BIDS layout
* **Standard metadata files** describing participants, dataset structure, and channels
* Events and derivatives for reproducibility

<Tip>
Because BIDS enforces strict formatting rules, the **subject identifier (`sub-XXXX`)** inside the `bids/` folder will not necessarily match the original filename.  
To see how subjects are linked to original recordings, check the **`participants.tsv`** file, which maps subject IDs to participant metadata.
</Tip>

## File and Folder Overview

| File / Folder                  | Purpose                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`dataset_description.json`** | Required by BIDS. Records dataset name, pipeline version, and references.                     |
| **`participants.tsv`**         | Table listing subjects and basic attributes (age, sex, etc.).                                 |
| **`participants.json`**        | Sidecar describing the meaning, format, and units of each column in `participants.tsv`.       |
| **`README`**                   | Free-text description of the dataset, study, or preprocessing notes.                          |
| **`sub-<ID>/`**                | Per-subject folder (e.g., `sub-451559`) containing the actual EEG data and metadata.          |
| **`derivatives/`**             | Preprocessed outputs from the pipeline (e.g., ICA-cleaned signals, epoched data, QC reports). |
| **`final_files/`**             | Convenience folder with cleaned, ready-to-use outputs (e.g., epoched datasets).               |


## What to Expect

* **Raw-like cleaned EEG** lives under each subject folder (`sub-<ID>`).
* **Metadata** (`dataset_description.json`, `participants.tsv/json`, `README`) ensures the dataset is machine-readable and human-readable.
* **Processed derivatives** contain artifacts-removed signals and QC artifacts.
* **Final files** provide shortcuts for quick analysis, without digging into the full BIDS tree.
