## The `final_files/` Folder

Although not part of the strict [BIDS standard](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/), AutoCleanEEG provides a **`final_files/`** folder inside the `bids/` directory.

This folder is meant as a **convenience export**: it gathers the most useful processed outputs in one place, so users can quickly start analysis without digging through derivatives or raw-like structures.

```
bids/
└── final_files/
    ├── 128_Rest_EyesOpen_D1004_processing_log.csv   (CSV summary of preprocessing)
    ├── 128_Rest_EyesOpen_D1004_processing.log       (detailed step log)
    └── 128_Rest_EyesOpen_D1004_comp_epo.set         (cleaned & epoched EEG dataset)
```

This shows the three main items that typically appear:
* **`*_processing_log.csv`** → concise summary table of the preprocessing run
* **`*_processing.log`** → step-by-step log output
* **`*_comp_epo.set`** → final, artifact-cleaned and epoched EEG dataset (EEGLAB format)

### Why it exists

* **Convenience**: Many users just want the “final” artifact-cleaned, epoched dataset without extra navigation.
* **Reproducibility**: Logs are included alongside the cleaned files for transparency.
* **Compatibility**: Outputs are still linked to the BIDS dataset, but collected in one easy-to-access folder.

<Info>
This folder is **not BIDS-compliant** and may not be recognized by external BIDS validators.  
It is provided purely for user convenience. For strict BIDS workflows, always use the `sub-*/` and `derivatives/` folders instead.
