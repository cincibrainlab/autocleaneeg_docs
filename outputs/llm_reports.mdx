AutoCleanEEG can optionally generate textual summaries using a large
language model. These reports live under each subject's
`metadata/llm_reports` folder and are built from the processing log and
PDF report.


<Info>By default AI reporting is disabled. Set `"ai_reporting": true`
in task config and provide `OPENAI_API_KEY` to enable.</Info>

<Warning>
**Privacy Considerations for LLM Reporting**

For 100% privacy, use a local language model instead of cloud-based APIs. When using OpenAI's API, ensure your setup includes zero data retention and a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) if handling Protected Health Information (PHI). Note that most data sent is deidentified and consists of aggregate processing metrics, not raw EEG data.
</Warning>

## Files Produced

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `context.json` | Serialized run context used to produce all text. |
| `methods.md` | Deterministic methods paragraph created without any API calls. |
| `executive_summary.md` | Study-ready summary produced by the LLM (requires API key). |
| `qc_narrative.md` | LLM-generated quality control narrative and recommendations (requires API key). |
| `llm_trace.jsonl` | Hash-based trace of prompts and results for compliance. |

## Enabling the Feature

1. Add `"ai_reporting": true` to your task configuration or workspace
   template.
2. Ensure an `OPENAI_API_KEY` is available in the environment.
3. Run the pipeline as usual â€“ reports appear under:

```text
bids/derivatives/autoclean-v<version>/metadata/llm_reports/
```

## CLI Usage

You can regenerate reports or chat about a run from the command line:

```bash
autocleaneeg-pipeline report create --run-id demo --context-json ./context.json \
  --out-dir ./reports
autocleaneeg-pipeline report chat --context-json ./context.json
```

`report create` always writes `context.json` and `methods.md`. If an API
key is present, it also generates `executive_summary.md` and
`qc_narrative.md`.

## When to Use

- Share short summaries with collaborators.
- Capture deterministic methods text for manuscripts.
- Quickly review quality metrics without opening the full PDF.

<Info>Missing API keys or expected input files never break your run; the
pipeline simply skips LLM outputs.</Info>
