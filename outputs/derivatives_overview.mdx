## The `derivatives/` Folder

The `derivatives/` folder follows the [BIDS derivatives standard](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/), where processed data are kept separate from raw-like files.
Each pipeline version creates its own subfolder, ensuring that outputs remain traceable to the exact software and parameters used.

### Example Layout

```
bids/
└── derivatives/
    └── autoclean-v2.2.1/
        ├── dataset_description.json
        ├── metadata/          (pipeline-specific metadata)
        ├── intermediate/      (temporary / intermediate outputs)
        ├── logs/              (detailed run logs)
        └── sub-451559/        (subject-level cleaned outputs)
```

### Key Components

| Item                           | Purpose                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`autoclean-v2.2.1/`**        | Pipeline-specific derivatives folder, versioned for traceability.                                                   |
| **`dataset_description.json`** | Required by BIDS derivatives. Documents the pipeline, version, and references.                                      |
| **`metadata/`**                | Stores additional pipeline metadata (e.g., preprocessing settings, QC parameters).                                  |
| **`intermediate/`**            | Temporary or step-wise files (not always needed for downstream analyses, but useful for debugging).                 |
| **`logs/`**                    | Processing logs at the derivative level, providing more detail than the top-level workspace logs.                   |
| **`sub-<ID>/`**                | Subject-level cleaned outputs, in BIDS derivative format (e.g., artifact-corrected EEG, ICA solutions, epoch sets). |

### Why Derivatives Matter

* **Traceability**: Every derivative is tied to a pipeline version (`autoclean-v2.2.1`), making analyses reproducible.
* **Separation of concerns**: Raw-like BIDS inputs are preserved, while processed data live here.
* **Compatibility**: Other BIDS-aware tools know to look in `derivatives/` for cleaned or secondary outputs.
* **Debugging**: `metadata/`, `logs/`, and `intermediate/` help you track down how results were produced.

<Info>
If disk space is limited, you can archive or delete the **`intermediate/`** folder after successful runs. The **final cleaned outputs** will remain in `sub-<ID>/`.
