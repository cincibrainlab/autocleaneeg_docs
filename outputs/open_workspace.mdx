Each **AutoCleanEEG Pipeline** run generates a structured workspace folder containing logs, database records, and standardized outputs in BIDS format. This organization ensures your results are both reproducible and easy to review.

<Note>
Output folders are named after the task you run, so multiple tasks can coexist within the same project.  
If you rerun a task, the existing folder is automatically backed up with the run date appended, ensuring previous results are preserved and never overwritten.
</Note>

Each task creates its own subfolder. Reruns generate a timestamped backup to prevent overwriting results


## Opening the Workspace Folder

By default, the workspace is created as **`Autoclean-EEG`** inside your **Documents** directory.

To open the workspace directly from the terminal, run:

```bash
autocleaneeg-pipeline workspace explore
```

This command will:

* Locate your active workspace.
* Launch your system’s file explorer at that location:

  * **macOS** → Finder
  * **Linux** → Nautilus (or your system’s default file manager)
  * **Windows** → File Explorer

## Next Steps

* Explore the `bids/` subfolder for BIDS-compliant outputs.
* Check `*_processing_log.csv` for a detailed summary of the run.
* Use backups (`*_YYYY-MM-DD/`) to compare results across different preprocessing runs.
