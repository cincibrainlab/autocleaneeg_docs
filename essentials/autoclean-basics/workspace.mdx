# Workspace: Your Command Center

The Workspace is a dedicated folder where Autoclean keeps your custom tasks, outputs, and configuration.

## Smart Setup

- First run: Autoclean creates `~/Documents/Autoclean-EEG/` automatically
- No manual config needed to get started

### Structure

```text
Autoclean-EEG/
├── tasks/           # Your custom Python task files
├── tasks/builtin/   # Example tasks from Autoclean
├── output/          # Processing results
└── example_basic_usage.py
```

### “Drop-and-Go” Magic

Drop a `.py` task file into `tasks/` and it’s instantly available.

```bash
# Copy your custom task
cp my_mmn_experiment.py ~/Documents/Autoclean-EEG/tasks/

# It’s immediately available
autocleaneeg-pipeline process MyMmnExperiment data.raw
```
