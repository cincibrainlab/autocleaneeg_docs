# The Three Pillars

Think of AutocleanEEG Pipeline as your personal EEG lab. Everything revolves around three simple concepts:

- Workspace: where Autoclean keeps your tasks, outputs, and config
- Task: what analysis to run (built-in or custom)
- Source: where your EEG data lives

These work together with smart defaults. If you don’t specify something, Autoclean uses your saved defaults or asks you.

## What You’ll Learn

- Set up your Workspace for “drop-and-go” usage
- Pick or write a Task and make it active
- Set a Source for files or directories
- Rely on sensible defaults and fallbacks to move fast

## Quick Mental Model

- Task selection: CLI argument → active Task → prompt
- File selection: CLI argument → task config → active Source → prompt
- Output location: CLI argument → Workspace/output → current directory

Next: set up your Workspace.
