description: Three real-world usage patterns to speed up daily work.

---

# Workflows

## 1) Lazy but efficient

```bash
# One-time setup
autocleaneeg-pipeline task set MyExperiment
autocleaneeg-pipeline source set   # choose your data folder

# Daily usage (minimal)
autocleaneeg-pipeline process
```

## 2) Multiple studies

```bash
# Keep workspace flexible
autocleaneeg-pipeline source set   # choose "No Default"

# Explicit processing
autocleaneeg-pipeline process RestingEyesOpen /data/study1/
autocleaneeg-pipeline process ASSR /data/study2/ --recursive
```

## 3) Developing new tasks

```bash
# Edit task file
vim ~/Documents/Autoclean-EEG/tasks/my_new_method.py

# Test immediately (no restart needed)
autocleaneeg-pipeline process MyNewMethod test_data.raw

# Set as active for repeated testing
autocleaneeg-pipeline task set MyNewMethod
```
