The `autocleaneeg-pipeline` command is the main way to interact with AutoClean EEG from your terminal. It handles setup, data processing, reviewing results, and managing custom tasks.

Running `autocleaneeg-pipeline` launches a **command-line interface (CLI)** with subcommands. Think of it as a “swiss-army knife” where you choose what action you want to perform.

The simplest way to use AutoClean EEG is to run the CLI with no arguments.
Just type:

```bash
autocleaneeg-pipeline
```
