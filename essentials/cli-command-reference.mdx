## üõ†Ô∏è What Happens Internally

When you run the CLI:

1. **Header & Context**  
   Shows your Python version, OS, current time, workspace path, and free disk space.
2. **Parse Your Command**  
   The CLI looks at the command (`process`, `setup`, `review`, etc.) and any options you provided.
3. **Validate Inputs**  
   It checks that required files/directories exist and that task names are correct.
4. **Run the Command**
   - `process`: Starts the EEG pipeline, running the chosen task on your file(s).
   - `list-tasks`: Scans and lists built-in + custom tasks.
   - `review`: Launches a GUI for reviewing results.
   - `view`: Opens EEG files in a viewer.
   - `setup`: Guides you through workspace or compliance configuration.
5. **Output Messages**  
   Messages are styled with clear tags (`info`, `success`, `error`, `warning`).
